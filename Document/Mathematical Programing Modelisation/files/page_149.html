  <td><font face="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" size="3">A fairly common application of IP is to the <i>depot location problem.</i> This is the problem of deciding where to locate depots (or warehouses or even factories) in order to supply customers. Two sorts of costs may enter the problem, the capital costs of building the depots and the distribution costs resulting from particular sitings of the depots. This sort of problem can be modelled using IP. Frequently the resultant model is a mixed integer problem. The DEPOT LOCATION problem of Part 2 is an example.</font></td>

  <td><font face="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" size="3">As was mentioned in Chapter 7, non-linear problems can sometimes be treated as IP problems with advantage. If the problem can be expressed in a separable programming form it can be solved using either separable programming as described in Section 7.3 or by IP. Should the problem be convex (this term is explained in Section 7.2) it may be treated by LP and no difficulty arises. On the other hand, special methods have to be used for non-convex problems where separable programming has the disadvantage of producing possibly local optima (this is again explained in Section 7.2). IP overcomes this difficulty and produces a true (global) optimal solution, although possibly with considerably more expenditure in computer time. Problems to which this method is relevant have already been mentioned in Chapter 7. They include problems involving <i>economies of scale, quadratic programming problems</i> and <i>geometric programming problems</i> as well as much more general non-linear programming problems.</font></td>

  <td><font face="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" size="3">The way in which such problems can be converted into a separable form is described in Chapter 7. How to convert the resultant separable problems into an IP form is described in Chapter 9. There is, however, an alternative way of approaching such problems by integer programming. This is through the use of special ordered sets of variables. A number of package programs have facilities for dealing with IP problems in this way to considerable computational advantage. The concept of special ordered sets and how they may be applied to non-linear problems (as well as other types of problem) is described by Beale and Tomlin (1969).</font></td>

  <td><font face="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" size="3">A very common application of IP is the <i>fixed charge problem.</i> This occurs when the cost of an activity involves a threshold set-up cost as well as the usual costs which rise in proportion to the level of the activity. In this way the problem can be regarded as non-linear. For example, if it is decided to produce any amount of a product at all it may be necessary to set up a piece of machinery. This set-up cost is independent of the quantity produced. It is not possible to model this situation using conventional LP but it can be modelled very easily using IP. This is described in Example 1 of Section 9.1.</font></td>
