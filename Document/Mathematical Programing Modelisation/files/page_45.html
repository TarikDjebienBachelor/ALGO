  <td><font face="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" size="3">These relations give equality constraints. The block angular structure of Figure 4.2 arises through these equality constraints providing common rows linking consecutive time periods.

Such a multi-period model arises from the FOOD MANUFACTURE problem of Part 2. This problem is the blending problem of Section 1.2 taken over six months with different raw oil prices for different months. Full details of the formulation of this problem are given in Part 3.</font></td>

  <td><font face="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" size="3">The way in which multi-period models should be used is important. Such a model is usually run with the first period relating to the present times and subsequent periods relating to the future. As a result only the operating decisions suggested by the model for the present month are acted on. Operating decisions for future months will probably only be taken as provisional. After a further month (or the appropriate time period) has elapsed the model will be rerun with updated data and the first period applying to the new present period. In this way a multi-period model is in constant use as both an operating tool for the present and a provisional planning tool for the future.</font></td>

  <td><font face="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" size="3">A further point of importance in multi-period models concerns what happens at the end of the last time period in the model. If the stocks at the end of the last period which occur in constraints (4) are included simply as variables the optimal solution will almost always decide that they should be zero. From the point of view of the model this would be sensible as it would be the minimum cost or maximum profit solution. In a practical situation, however, the model is unrealistic since operations will almost certainly continue beyond the end of the last period and stocks would probably not be allowed to run right down. One possible way out is to set the final stocks to constant values representing sensible final levels. It could be argued that the operating plans for the final period will be very provisional anyway and any inaccuracy that far ahead not serious. This is the suggestion that is made for dealing with both the multiperiod FACTORY PLANNING and FOOD MANUFACTURE problems of Part 2. An alternative approach which is sometimes adopted is to value the final stocks in some way, i.e. give the appropriate variables positive profits in a maximization model or negative costs in a minimization model. In effect such a valuation would cause the optimal solution to suggest producing final stocks to sell if it appeared profitable. Although the organization might never consider the possibility of selling off final stocks, the fact that they had been given realistic valuations would cause them to come out at sensible levels.</font></td>
