In fact the increasing disadvantages of greater and greater centralization have been a major factor in discouraging the continual growth in the size of mathematical programming models.</font></td>

  <td><font face="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" size="3">In theory, decomposition, which was discussed in Section 4.2, offers a way out by avoiding the need to include all the detail of an organization in one total model. Unfortunately the computational problems of using a decomposition method in general have not yet been fully resolved. At present it cannot be considered to be a sufficiently developed technique to be always usable in practice. Moreover, mathematical methods of decomposition do not always correspond to acceptable decentralized planning methods. This aspect of the subject has been discussed by Atkins (1974).</font></td>

  <td><font face="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" size="3">Stewart (1971) rather surprisingly suggests that the use of a long-term planning model in British Petroleum led to some degree of decentralization. In particular it was then possible for a division to obtain complete information before making a plan themselves rather than the information being restricted to head office. This enabled the division to take on more responsibility. On the other hand, the division now had to work within some centrally defined objective rather than choose its own objective. People now, however, felt that they were working to an independent system, in the form of a model, rather than being simply dictated to by head office. This, to some extent, made centralization more acceptable.</font></td>

  <td><font face="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" size="3">As was pointed out in Chapter 6, a wealth of information can be obtained from the solution to a linear programming model. For large corporate models this excess of information can create difficulties. It is very important to ensure that departments only get relevant information. Otherwise they can be submerged. The use of an automatic report writer as discussed in Section 6.5 is obviously desirable. Such a report writer can be designed to produce the information in different sections for the use of different departments.</font></td>

  <td><font face="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" size="3">It is necessary to strike a correct balance between the model builders, the contributors of data and the managers who use the results. There is a great danger, in a large organization, of them losing touch with one another. Relevant data may not be used at the right time and inaccurate results obtained. Ideally management will become accustomed to using a model on a what if basis. They will ask questions which the model builder will be able to answer quickly by new runs or post-optimal analysis.</font></td>

  <td><font face="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" size="3">The degree of centralization or decentralization which the use of a model should be allowed to impose on an organization must obviously depend very much on the organization and its ultimate objectives. In consequence few general guidelines can be given. The recognition of the problem of centralization is, however, important. It is interesting that mathematical programming was used quite widely in the former communist countries for national economic planning. In the west this is far less common. Models are usually limited to the level of individual companies.</font></td>
