  <td><font face="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" size="3">A very straightforward allocation problem is given in Part 2. This is the MARKET SHARE problem. The problem involves allocating customers to divisions in a company for their services. Although the formulation is comparatively straightforward, problems like this are not always easy to solve. Problems of a very similar form arise in <i>project selection</i> and <i>capital budget allocation.</i></font></td>

  <td><font face="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" size="3">The class of allocation problems includes two problems already mentioned for which IP is not needed. It has been pointed out in Section 5.3 that in the <i>transportation problem</i> it is not necessary to impose an integrality requirement. The LP optimal solution will automatically be integer because of the structure of the problem. As the <i>assignment problem</i> can be regarded as a special case of the transportation problem, this property holds for it also. Fortunately these two problems, although apparently IP problems, can therefore be treated as LP problems and solved fairly easily. Other apparently IP problems also have this property or can be formulated to have this property with great computational advantage. This topic is treated further in Sections 10.1 and 10.2. A complicated extension of the assignment problem is the <i>quadratic assignment problem.</i> This problem occurs where the cost of an assignment is not independent of other assignments. The resulting problem can be regarded as an assignment problem with a quadratic objective function. The quadratic terms can be converted into linear expressions reducing the problem to an IP problem. The quadratic assignment problem is one of the most difficult combinatorial problems known in mathematical programming. Fairly small problems can be tackled by reducing the problem to a linear IP model. The DECENTRALIZATION example of Part 2 is a special sort of quadratic assignment problem. The quadratic assignment problem is discussed further in Section 9.5.</font></td>

  <td><font face="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" size="3">A practical problem which arises and can be regarded as falling into the allocation category is the <i>assembly line balancing</i> problem. This is the problem of assigning workers to tasks on a production line to achieve a given production rate. It is possible to formulate this problem as an IP problem and solve it fairly easily. The usual formulation results in a special sort of IP model known as a <i>set partitioning problem.</i> This type of problem is discussed further in Section 9.5.</font></td>

In practice this type of problem frequently involves an enormous number of potential rosters and is difficult to solve as an IP problem in consequence. This is discussed further in Section 9.5.</font></td>
