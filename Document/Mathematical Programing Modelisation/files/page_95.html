If such a constraint has been inadvertently overlooked, the solution which the package program prints before giving up can be of use in detecting it. A common sense examination of this solution may reveal that things do not add up, e.g. we may find we are producing something without using any raw material.</font></td>

  <td><font face="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" size="3">In Section 6.2 we define an associated linear programming model for every model known as the <i>dual model.</i> This model can have important economic interpretations. If a model is unbounded the corresponding dual model is infeasible. It is therefore conceivable that a practical unbounded model might arise as the dual to an infeasible model where we were testing whether a certain course of action was or was not possible. Should a model be infeasible we should not assume that its dual will necessarily be unbounded. It is possible that the dual will also be infeasible.</font></td>

  <td><font face="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" size="3">Should a linear programming model be neither infeasible nor unbounded we will refer to it as <i>solvable.</i> When we obtain the optimal solution to such a model we clearly want to know if the answer is sensible. If it is not sensible then there must be something wrong with our model. The first approach should be to examine the optimal solution critically simply using common sense. This may well reveal an obvious nonsense which should enable us to detect and correct a modelling error.</font></td>

  <td><font face="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" size="3">Should the solution still appear sensible we could compare the optimal objective value with what we might expect in practice. If, in a maximization problem, this value is lower than we expect, we might suspect that our model is over restrictive, i.e. some constraints are too severe. On the other hand, if the optimal objective is higher than we expect, we might suspect that our model is insufficiently restrictive, i.e. that some constraints are too weak or have been left out. For minimization problems these conclusions would obviously be reversed. To give an example, suppose we were considering a product mix application such as that considered in Section 1.2. On solving the model we would obtain a maximum profit contribution. Suppose this profit contribution was lower than what we already knew we could attain, e.g. suppose it was lower than what we obtained in a previous week (assuming there had been no subsequent cut-back in productive capacity). In this circumstance we would obviously suspect our model to be over restrictive. To find where the over severe constraints lay we could substitute our known better solution into the constraints of our model. Some of these constraints will obviously be violated and must therefore have been modelled incorrectly. Possibly we may find that there is some productive capacity which we were unaware of but is being used by the workforce. Our model, even though not yet correct, will already be proving valuable in helping to discover things we were unaware of.</font></td>
