  <td><font face="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" size="3">parts are, however, rather more advanced and present fairly new material. This is particularly true of the chapters on integer programming. Indeed this book can be treated in a non-sequential manner. There is much cross-referencing to enable the reader to pass from one relevant section to another. This book is aimed at three types of reader:</font></td>

  <td><font face="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" size="3">(1) It is intended to provide students in universities and polytechnics with a solid foundation in the principles of model building as well as the more mathematical, algorithmic side of the subject which is conventionally taught. For students who finally go on to use mathematical programming to solve real problems the model building aspect is probably the more important. The problems of Part 2 provide practical exercises in problem formulation. By formulating models and solving them with the aid of a computer, students learn the art of formulation in the most satisfying way possible. They can compare their numerical solutions with those of other students obtained from differently built models. In this way they learn how to validate a model.</font></td>

  <td><font face="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" size="3">It is also hoped that these problems will be of use to research students seeking new algorithms for solving mathematical programming problems. Very often they have to rely on trivial or randomly generated models to test their computational procedures. Such models are far from typical of those found in the real world. Moreover they are one (or more) steps removed from practical situations. They therefore obscure the need for efficient formulations as well as algorithms.</font></td>

  <td><font face="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" size="3">(3) Finally, constructing a mathematical model of an organization provides one of the best methods of understanding that organization. It is hoped that the general reader will be able to use the principles described in this book to build mathematical models and therefore learn about the functioning of systems which purely verbal descriptions fail to explain. It has been the author's experience that the process of building a model of an organization can often be more beneficial even than the obtaining of a solution. A greater understanding of the complex interconnections between different facets of an organization is forced upon anybody who realistically attempts to model that organization.</font></td>
