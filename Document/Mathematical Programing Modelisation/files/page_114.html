The resultant increase in the objective is 1 × 0.5 = 0.5. We can continue to increase the right-hand side coefficient to 5 when this boundary of the feasible region shrinks to the point D. There is clearly no virtue in further increasing the right-hand side coefficient since the point D will continue to represent the optimal solution. The <i>upper range</i> on the right-hand side coefficient in constraint (6) therefore is obviously 5.</font></td>

  <td><font face="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" size="3">If constraint (6) is tightened by decreasing the right-hand side coefficient, the boundary AB of the feasible region progressively moves down until it becomes CE. This happens when the right-hand side coefficient is 3. Any decreases in this coefficient between 4 and 3 result in a degradation of the objective by 1 (the shadow price) for each unit of decrease. The value 3 is the <i>lower range.</i> For decreases in coefficient values below 3 the optimal objective value will decrease at a greater rate. This rate will not immediately be predictable from our knowledge of the solution at A. For decreases down to 3 the optimal objective value is represented by points on the line AC. Decreases below 3 give points on the line CF.</font></td>

  <td><font face="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" size="3">So far we have only suggested using right-hand side ranges together with shadow prices to investigate the effect which changes on the right-hand side coefficients have on the optimal objective value. Such investigations sometimes give rise to the expression <i>post-optimal analysis.</i> Another purpose to which such information can be put is in investigating the sensitivity of the model to the right-hand side data. This forms part of a subject known as <i>sensitivity analysis.</i></font></td>

  <td><font face="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" size="3">We will consider this new use to which right-hand side ranging information can be put in relation to the product mix model. Suppose we were rather doubtful about the accuracy of the grinding capacity of 288 hours per week (constraint (2)). In practice it is quite likely that such a figure would be open to doubt since machines could well be down for maintenance or repair for durations which were not wholly predictable. How confident should we be in suggesting that the factory dispenses with making PROD 3, PROD 4, and PROD 5 and only concentrates on PROD 1 and PROD 2? From our range information we can immediately say that this should remain the optimal policy as long as the true capacity figure does not lie outside the limits 230.4 to 384. Although the policy (in terms of what is, and is not, made) does not change within these limits, the levels at which PROD 1 and PROD 2 are made (and the resultant profit) obviously will change. This information is therefore of limited, but nevertheless sometimes significant, usefulness. Obviously if there is doubt about one capacity figure there will probably also be doubt about others and ranging information can only strictly be applied when one change only is made. Nevertheless such information does give some indication of the sensitivity of the solution to accuracy in the right-hand side data. If, for example, the ranges on the right-hand side coefficient in constraint (2) had been very close, say 287 to 288.5, we would have to be very careful in applying our suggested solution since it clearly would depend very critically on the accuracy of the grinding capacity figure.</font></td>
