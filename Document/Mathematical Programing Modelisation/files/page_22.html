  <td><font face="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" size="3">A first approach to a problem with multiple objectives is to solve the model a number of times with each objective in turn. The comparison of the different results may suggest a satisfactory solution to the problem or indicate further investigations. A fairly obvious example of two objectives each of which can be optimized in turn is given by the MANPOWER PLANNING problem of Part 2. Here either <i>cost</i> or <i>redundancy</i> can be minimized. The computational task of using different objectives in turn is eased if each solution is used as a starting solution to a run with a new objective as mentioned in Section 2.3.</font></td>

  <td><font face="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" size="3">Objectives and constraints can often be interchanged, e.g. we may wish to pursue some desirable social objective so long as costs do not exceed a specified level or alternatively we may wish to minimize cost using the social consideration as a constraint on our operations. This interplay between objectives and constraints is a feature of many mathematical programming models which is far too rarely recognized. Once a model has been built it is extremely easy to convert an objective to a constraint or vice versa. The proper use for such a model is to solve it a number of times, making such changes. An examination and discussion of the resultant solutions should lead to an understanding of the operating options available in the practical situation which has been modelled. We therefore have one method of coping with multiple objectives through treating all but one objective as a constraint. Experiments can then be carried out by varying the objective to be optimized as well as the right-hand side values of the objective/constraints.</font></td>

  <td><font face="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" size="3">Another way of tackling multiple objectives is to take a suitable linear combination of all the objective functions and optimize that. It is clearly necessary to attach relative weightings or utilities to the different objectives. What these weightings should be may often be a matter of personal judgment. Again it will probably be necessary to experiment with different such composite objectives in order to map out a series of possible solutions. Such solutions can then be presented to the decision makers as policy options. Most commercial packages allow the user to define and vary the weightings of composite objective functions very easily. It should not be thought that this approach to multiple objectives is completely distinct from the approach of treating all but one of the objectives as a constraint. When a linear programming model is solved each constraint has associated with it a value known as a <i>shadow price.</i> These values have considerable economic importance and are discussed at length in Section 6.2. If these shadow prices were to be used as the weightings to be given to the objectives/constraints in the composite approach that we have described in this paragraph, then the same optimal solution could be obtained.</font></td>

  <td><font face="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" size="3">When objectives are in conflict, as multiple objectives frequently will be to some extent, any of the above approaches can be adopted. Care must be taken, however, when objectives are replaced by constraints not to model conflicting constraints as such. The resultant model would clearly be infeasible. Conflicting constraints necessitate a relaxation in some or all of these constraints. Constraints become <i>goals</i> which may, or may not, be achieved. The degree of over, or under, achievement is represented in the objective function. This way of</font></td>
