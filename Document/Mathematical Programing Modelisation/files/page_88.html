  <td><font face="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" size="3">Building and conventionally solving the above linear programming model would be an inefficient method of finding the critical path. Special algorithms exist and there are widely used package programs for doing critical path analysis. Many extensions of the problem of scheduling a project in this way can be considered but are beyond the scope of this book. A full discussion of this subject is contained in Lockyer (1967).</font></td>

  <td><font face="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" size="3">One very practical extension of the problem is that of <i>allocating resources to the activities</i> in a project network. For example, in the network of Figure 5.8 both activity 45 (wiring) and activity 25 (roofing) may require people (although in this contrived example they would probably have different skills). If activity 45 requires three people and activity 25 requires six and there are only eight available, the optimal schedule given above is unattainable and one of those activities will have to be delayed or extended. The problem is then how to reschedule to achieve some objective. For example, the objective might well be to delay the overall completion time as little as possible. Alternatively there might be a desire to smooth the usage of this and other resources over time. This extension to the problem is mentioned again in Section 9.5 since it gives rise to an integer programming extension to the linear programming problem of the type above. Nevertheless integer programming would be generally far too costly in computer time to justify solving this type of problem in this way. A problem which gives rise to a very simple network is job-shop scheduling. This problem of scheduling jobs on machines can be regarded as a problem of allocating resources to activities in a network. The operations in the job shop (machining, etc.) give the activities. Sequencing relations between those operations give a (simple) network structure. The resources to be allocated are the limited machines.</font></td>

  <td><font face="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" size="3">All the problems described in this section (apart from the minimum cost multi-commodity network flow problem) are best tackled through specialized algorithms rather than the revised simplex algorithm available on commercial package programs. The reason for describing these problems and showing how they can, if necessary, be modelled as linear programs is that many practical problems are made up, in part, of network problems. Such problems often, however, contain additional complications which make it impossible to use a pure network model. This is where the conventional linear programming formulation becomes important. Many practical linear programming models have a very large network component. Such a feature usually makes very large models easy to solve using package programs. Some package programs have special features to take advantage of some of the network structure within a model. An example of this is the <i>generalized upper bound</i> (GUB) type of constraint which was mentioned in Section 3.3. In the linear programming formulation of the transportation problem in Example 1 constraints (2), (3), and (4) could be regarded as GUB constraints and not explicitly represented as constraints if a package with this facility was used. Alternatively (and preferably because there are more of them) constraints (5), (6), (7), and (8) could be represented as GUB constraints. The use of the GUB facility makes the solution</font></td>
