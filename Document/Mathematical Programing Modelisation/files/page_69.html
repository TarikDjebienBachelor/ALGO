  <td><font face="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" size="3">sometimes known as <i>primary goods.</i> Primary goods only provide inputs to the economy. They are not produced as outputs as well. A major advantage of treating such models as linear programming models is that a lot of subsidiary economic information is also obtained from solving such a model. Such information is described very fully in Section 6.2. In particular, valuations are obtained for the constraints of a model. These valuations are known as <i>shadow prices.</i> For the type of model considered here we would obtain meaningful valuations for the primary goods. In this way a pricing system could be introduced into our model. This would give suitable prices for the outputs from all the industries.</font></td>

  <td><font face="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" size="3">Although any number of primary goods can be considered in a linear programming formulation of an input-output model it is quite common only to consider labour. In practice, particularly in the relatively simple economies of developing countries, it may well not be unreasonable to consider labour as the overall limitation. If this can be done there is another less obvious advantage to be gained in the applicability of such a model. It has already been pointed out that an input-output model assumes <i>non-substitutability</i> of the inputs, i.e. it is not possible to vary the relative proportions in which all the inputs are used to produce the output of a particular industry. In practice this might well be a far from realistic assumption. For example, we might well be able to produce each unit of coal by using more power (more coal) and less machinery (less steel). To model this possibility would require a variation in the coefficients of the input-output matrix. It has been shown that if there is only one primary good (usually labour), then it will only be worthwhile to concentrate on one production process for each industry. This is the result of the <i>Samuelson substitution theorem</i> which we will not prove. Such theoretical results and a fuller description of input-output models are given in Dorfman, Samuelson, and Solow (1958). Another good reference is Shapiro (1979). The importance of this result is that we need not worry about the apparent non-substitutability limitation so long as we only have one primary good. There will be one, and only one best set of inputs (production processes) for each industry. This best production process will remain the best no matter what bill of goods we are producing. There is, of course, the problem of finding, for each industry, that production process which should be used. Once, however, this has been done, no matter what the bill of goods, we need only incorporate this one production process (column of the input-output matrix) into all future models. In fact the finding of the best production process for each industry can be done by linear programming. To illustrate how this may be done as well as illuminating the import of the Samuelson substitution theorem we will extend our small example. Table 5.2 gives two possible sets of inputs (production processes) to produce one unit of the three industries.</font></td>
