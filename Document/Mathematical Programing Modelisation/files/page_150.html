  <td><font face="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" size="3">It has already been pointed out in Section 5.3 that the problem of finding the critical path in a PERT network can be viewed as an LP problem. A secondary problem often arises in practice. This is the problem of <i>resource allocation on a PERT network.</i> It may be necessary to alter the order in which certain activities (arcs) are carried out in view of the limited resources available, e.g. we cannot simultaneously build the walls and lay the floors in a house if there are not enough workers available. The problem of optimally allocating these limited resources to the arcs of the PERT network so as to (for example) minimize the total completion time for a project can be formulated as an IP problem. Although an IP model is a method of tackling this problem, it is not to be recommended except in very simple cases. The computational difficulties of solving a complex problem of this kind by IP can be very great. In practice non-rigorous heuristic means are used to obtain useful but non-optimal solutions.</font></td>

  <td><font face="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" size="3">Many IP problems arise in <i>graph theory.</i> A well known problem to which IP is relevant is the <i>four-colour problem.</i> It has recently been proved that at most four colours are needed to colour every country on a map differently from its neighbouring countries. For any map, IP could be used to find the minimum number of colours necessary. The above problem can be represented as the problem of colouring the vertices of a graph so that vertices jointed by an edge are coloured differently. Other colouring problems arise in graph theory. For example, it is possible to devise problems involving colouring the edges of a graph. Although many such problems exist and can be solved using IP, such considerations are largely beyond the scope of this book. The concern here is mainly with practical problems. Graph theory and integer programming has been extensively treated elsewhere, for example by Christofides (1975).</font></td>

  <td><font face="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" size="3">The above five categories encompass most of the different types of problem which arise to which IP is applicable. In practice most problems which one meets fall into the second category. They are LP problems on which it is desired to impose extra conditions. These extra conditions are frequently of a logical type. One therefore extends the LP model by adding integer variables and extra constraints. The extra constraints applied to the integer variables sometimes have a combinatorial flavour. Sometimes these extra constraints serve the purpose of modelling non-linearities in an otherwise LP model.</font></td>

  <td><font face="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" size="3">Pure integer programming models arise less frequently in practice. They are usually combinatorial problems. The comparatively large number of combinatorial problems listed above should not disguise that fact that the majority of practical IP models are in the second category and may arise as extensions to almost any application of LP. Combinatorial problems do arise in practice, however, and are sometimes satisfactorily solved through IP. Great care must</font></td>
