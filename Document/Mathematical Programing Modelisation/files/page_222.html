  <td><font face="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" size="3">through a mathematical programming model. Day to day blending problems, for example, may be of this nature. Sometimes fertilizer suppliers or food manufacturers run small linear programming models for individual orders or blends. In such cases acceptance of the method must have already been achieved. An organizational problem will also have had to be solved probably by automating the conversion of the data into a standard type of model for quick solution by a computer (probably through a terminal). The use of such short term operational models creates few other implementation problems since once accepted their use is fairly straightforward.</font></td>

  <td><font face="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" size="3"><i>Medium term planning</i> is usually considered to involve periods of a month up to one or two years. It is for these problems that mathematical programming has been most widely used to date. Once a medium term planning model has been implemented and is being used regularly, it may be incorporated into, or form a starting point for, a <i>longer term planning</i> model typically looking up to about six years ahead. The problems of getting acceptance of such models are similar but usually more acute in the case of longer term planning. Both will be considered together.</font></td>

  <td><font face="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" size="3">Much has been written on the more general problem of how to gain acceptance for and ensure the implementation of the results of any operational research study. A clear and useful account of the considerations which should be made is given by Rivett (1968). The main lesson to be learnt is to involve the potential decision makers in a model building project at an early stage. If they have lived with the problems of defining and building a model they will be much more likely to accept and understand its final use than if it is sprung on them at a late stage. Early involvement by top management can have its dangers. It is possible that the development of a model may get bogged down in detailed technical arguments between managers who would normally never be concerned with such technicalities. More seriously a model building project might be rejected at an early stage through disagreement over detail. These risks are, however, normally worth taking in comparison with the risk of rejection at the final hurdle. Involving top management will often be by no means easy. They will need to understand the potentialities of a mathematical programming model but will probably lack both detailed technical knowledge as well as detailed departmental knowledge of some aspects of their company. Some of this detail may well need to be incorporated into the model. The solution is probably to involve one or two such managers in the model building project as well as give regular presentations to the others. There is then of course another danger to be avoided. It is important not to oversell the model. If it is thought that the model will answer every question, then later, disillusion may be in store.</font></td>

  <td><font face="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" size="3">Many people have found that a new mathematical programming model has gained acceptance when the answers which it produces confirm a decision which has already been made. For example, an important investment decision may have been made in some other way. If the answer to the model confirms this, the ultimate regular use of mathematical programming may be assured.</font></td>
