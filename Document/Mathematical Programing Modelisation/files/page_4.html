  <td><font face="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" size="3">Many models used in operational research (and other areas such as engineering and economics) take standard forms. The mathematical programming type of model which we consider in this book is probably the most commonly used standard type of model. Other examples of some commonly used mathematical models are <i>simulation models, network planning models, econometric models,</i> and <i>time series models.</i> There are many other types of model, all of which arise sufficiently often in practice to make them areas worthy of study in their own right. It should be emphasized, however, that any such list of standard types of model is unlikely to be exhaustive or exclusive. There are always practical situations which cannot be modelled in a standard way. The building, analysing, and experimenting with such new types of model may still be a valuable activity. Often practical problems can be modelled in more than one standard way (as well as in non-standard ways). It has long been realized by operational research workers that the comparison and contrasting of results from different types of model can be extremely valuable.</font></td>

  <td><font face="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" size="3">Many misconceptions exist about the value of mathematical models, particularly when used for planning purposes. At one extreme there are people who deny that models have any value at all when put to such purposes. Their criticisms are often based on the impossibility of satisfactorily quantifying much of the required data, e.g. attaching a cost or utility to a social value. A less severe criticism surrounds the lack of precision of much of the data which may go into a mathematical model; e.g. if there is doubt surrounding 100 000 of the coefficients in a model, how can we have any confidence in an answer it produces? The first of these criticisms is a difficult one to counter and has been tackled at much greater length by many defenders of cost-benefit analysis. It seems undeniable, however, that many decisions concerning unquantifiable concepts, however they are made, involve an implicit quantification which cannot be avoided. Making such a quantification explicit by incorporating it in a mathematical model seems more honest as well as scientific. The second criticism concerning accuracy of the data should be considered in relation to each specific model. Although many coefficients in a model may be inaccurate it is still possible that the structure of the model results in little inaccuracy in the solution. This subject is mentioned in depth in Section 6.3.</font></td>

  <td><font face="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" size="3">At the opposite extreme to the people who utter the above criticisms are those who place an almost metaphysical faith in a mathematical model for decision making (particularly if it involves using a computer). The quality of the answers which a model produces obviously depends on the accuracy of the structure and data of the model. For mathematical programming models the definition of the objective clearly affects the answer as well. Uncritical faith in a model is obviously unwarranted and dangerous. Such an attitude results from a total</font></td>
