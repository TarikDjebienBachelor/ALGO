  <td><font face="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" size="3">To sum up the characteristics of a whole industry or sector of an economy in one column of an input-output matrix obviously requires a large amount of simplification of the real situation. It is necessary to group together many different industries into one. This <i>aggregation</i> is necessary in order to obtain a reasonable size of problem. Most input-output models are aggregated into less than 1000 industries. The problem of aggregation is obviously of paramount concern to the model builder. Unfortunately very little theoretical work has been done to indicate <i>mathematically</i> when aggregation is and is not justified. Three criteria which common sense would suggest to be good grounds for aggregating particular industries are: (i) substitutability, (ii) complementarity, and (iii) similarity of production processes. Problems of this sort are discussed more fully by Stone (1960).</font></td>

  <td><font face="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" size="3">In view of their sophistication and efficiency commercial mathematical programming packages provide a useful way of solving input-output models. Even if the model is of the simplest kind described above and only requires the solution of a set of simultaneous equations such packages are of use. Almost all packages contain an inversion routine which is very useful for inverting large matrices (sets of simultaneous equations). It should, however, be pointed out that input-output models are often quite dense. In this respect they are untypical of general linear programming models. As already mentioned in Section 2.1, in a thousand-constraint model one would expect only about 1% of the coefficients to be non-zero. For an input-output model this figure could well be as high as 50%. As a result input-output models can take a long time to solve on a computer and run into numerical difficulties. It is sometimes worth exploiting the special structure of an input-output linear programming model and using a special purpose algorithm. Dantzig (1955) describes how the simplex algorithm can be adapted to this purpose.</font></td>

  <td><font face="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" size="3">The use of models involving networks is very widespread in operational research. Problems involving distribution, assignment, and planning (critical path analysis and PERT) frequently give rise to the analysis of networks. Many of the resultant problems can be regarded as special types of linear programming problem. It is often more efficient to use special purpose algorithms rather than the revised simplex algorithm. Nevertheless it is important for the model builder to be aware when he is dealing with a special kind of linear programming model. In order to solve his model it may be useful to adapt the simplex algorithm to suit the special structure. It may even, sometimes, be worth ignoring the special structure and using a general purpose package program. Since such programs are often highly efficient and well designed their speeds outweigh the algorithmic efficiency of less well designed but more specialized programs.</font></td>
