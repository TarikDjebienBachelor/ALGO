  <td><font face="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" size="3">Mathematical programs are among the most widely used models in operational research and management science. In many cases their application has been so successful that their use has passed out of operational research departments to become an accepted routine planning tool. It is therefore rather surprising that comparatively little attention has been paid in the literature to the problems of formulating and building mathematical programming models or even deciding when such a model is applicable. Most published work has tended to be of two kinds. Firstly, case studies of particular applications have been described in the operational research journals and journals relating to specific industries. Secondly, research work on new algorithms for special classes of problems has provided much material for the more theoretical journals. This book attempts to fill the gap by, in Part 1, discussing the general principles of model building in mathematical programming. In Part 2, 24 practical problems are presented to which mathematical programming can be applied. By simplifying the problems, much of the tedious institutional detail of case studies is avoided. It is hoped, however, that the essence of the problems is preserved and easily understood. Finally, in Parts 3 and 4, suggested formulations and solutions to the problems are given together with some computational experience.</font></td>

  <td><font face="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" size="3">Many books already exist on mathematical programming or, in particular, linear programming. Most such books adopt the conventional approach of paying a great deal of attention to algorithms. Since the algorithmic side has been so well and fully covered by other texts it is given much less attention in this book. The concentration here is much more on the building and interpreting of models rather than the solution process. Nevertheless, it is hoped that this book may spur the reader to delve more deeply into the often challenging algorithmic side of the subject as well. It is, however, the author's contention that the practical problems and model building aspect should come first. This may then provide a motivation for finding out how to solve such models. Although desirable, knowledge of algorithms is no longer necessary if practical use is to be made of mathematical programming. The solution of practical models is now largely automated by the use of commercial package programs which are discussed in Chapter 2.</font></td>
