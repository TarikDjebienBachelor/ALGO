  <td><font face="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" size="3">One of the possibly contentious results of decisions which may be reached through a corporate model should be recognized. Because such a model will have a corporate objective, this may conflict within the objectives of individual departments. It has already been pointed out that a marketing division may force them to reduce their product range and therefore their total volume in the interests of greater company profit. The disputes that may result in consequence are added reason for obtaining top management backing for this method of planning. In Section 4.1 it was demonstrated through a very simple example how a corporate objective could result in an individual factory having its individual profit reduced in the interests of overall company profit. Again the possible political implications are obvious.</font></td>

  <td><font face="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" size="3">Although there may be obvious difficulties in getting different departments to work more closely together, there can be advantages resulting from a planning model. The combination of a large amount of data and information in one computer model can lead to greater convenience. Each department can be given the relevant portions of a computer run. Problems of communication and incompatibility of information will be reduced in consequence. One of the by-products of a corporate model is usually greater contact between departments. Each department will want to know what information other departments have fed into the model, since this may affect the suggested plans for their own department.</font></td>

Such a model may well provide operating information for the current time period as well as provisional information for future periods. Such a model would generally be rerun at least once in each period, giving the same combination of operating information and planning information based on the best available future estimates which have been fed into the model.</font></td>

Sometimes these divisions may be separated geographically. In some respects the greater centralization of planning which results may seem desirable. The small example of Section 4.1 demonstrated how individual factories in a company might produce sub-optimal plans when working independently. In the last section it was pointed out how the recognition of the interdependence of different departments in an organization often results from a model. Although many of these</font></td>
